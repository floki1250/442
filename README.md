# 442 - Football Universe

üöÄ"442" - a universal football app designed to revolutionize how you organize matches! ‚öΩÔ∏è

I developed "442" to help my friend streamline the process of setting up local games with teammates. Built with Nuxt and Vercel KV, this app provides a comprehensive platform for football enthusiasts, offering:

- Live Scores: Stay updated with real-time scores.

- Football News: Get the latest updates from the football world.

- Match Organization: Easily organize local games by entering team members, date, time, and location, then share the game code with participants.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
